I need to filter data from JSON retriewed from public API by population e.g. <10m

Certainly! To filter data from a JSON retrieved from a public API based on population, you can use JavaScript and the Array.filter() method. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

javascript
Copy code
// Assume the `jsonData` variable contains the JSON data retrieved from the public API
const jsonData = [
  { country: 'Country A', population: 5000000 },
  { country: 'Country B', population: 15000000 },
  { country: 'Country C', population: 8000000 },
  { country: 'Country D', population: 20000000 },
  // ... more data
];

// Filter the data based on population less than 10 million
const filteredData = jsonData.filter((item) => item.population < 10000000);

// Output the filtered data
console.log(filteredData);
In the above example, we assume the JSON data retrieved from the public API is stored in the jsonData variable. We then use the filter() method on the jsonData array and provide a callback function as an argument. The callback function takes each item in the array and checks if its population property is less than 10 million. Only the items that satisfy this condition are included in the filteredData array. Finally, we log the filteredData array to the console.

Please note that you need to replace jsonData with the actual JSON data retrieved from the public API. Also, adjust the property names (country and population) in the code based on your JSON structure.
