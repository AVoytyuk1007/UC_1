I need to show first n data rows from JSON retriewed from public API based on accepted parameter with rows number

Sure! To retrieve data from a public API and display the first n data rows based on a specified parameter, you can follow these steps using Node.js:

Install the necessary dependencies: You'll need the axios library to make HTTP requests and fetch data from the API. You can install it by running the following command in your project directory:
shell
Copy code
npm install axios
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., app.js) and require the axios module:
javascript
Copy code
const axios = require('axios');
Define a function that fetches data from the API and returns the desired number of rows. Here's an example implementation:
javascript
Copy code
async function fetchData(url, rows) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    const data = response.data;
    return data.slice(0, rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message);
    return [];
  }
}
In the above code, the fetchData function takes in the url of the API and the number of rows to retrieve. It uses the axios library to make a GET request to the API and then returns the specified number of rows from the received data.

Invoke the fetchData function with the API URL and the desired number of rows, and log the result:
javascript
Copy code
const apiUrl = 'https://example.com/api/data'; // Replace with the actual API URL
const numberOfRows = 10; // Replace with the desired number of rows

fetchData(apiUrl, numberOfRows)
  .then(result => {
    console.log('Retrieved data rows:', result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  });
Replace 'https://example.com/api/data' with the actual URL of the public API you want to retrieve data from, and '10' with the desired number of rows to display.

Run the Node.js script by executing the following command in your project directory:
shell
Copy code
node app.js
This will run the script and display the first n data rows from the API based on the accepted parameter.

Make sure to adapt the code according to the structure and requirements of the specific API you are working with.
